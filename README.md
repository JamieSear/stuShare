## About stuShare:
- stuShare offers a place for University students to share interesting resources that they have found whilst completing their course. This can provide people from different universities to gain a different view on a subject/topic

- stuSpace also provides students to develop a different scope of material from students of other universities rather than JUST the required readings for their University course.

- Students can also help others out by providing a different view on a topic through a comment on a post. This can allow for students from different universities to showcase their understanding of a topic and learn even more from others
